BornHack 20XX: design and implementation of traffic control measures on the roads outside the venue. This concerns:

    Hylkedamvej main road to junction
    junction to parking area
    junction to main gate


Technical aspects:

    Requirements:

    Battery powered (Makita 18V?)
    Wireless (LoRaWan?)
    Visible in bright sunlight
    IP44 rated enclosures
    Fallback to dumb mode (X minutes green #1, Y minutes red #1 and #2, X minutes green #2 ...) on central comms or sensor failure

    Nice to have:

    Autonomous detection of vehicles, fallback to "Press This Button". Minimal false triggers on non-car/truck vehicles (bikes, deer, snails etc.)
    Local status screen 
    Single pole-mountable unit
    Multiple vehicle-detection methods 


Operational/logistical aspects:

     Requirements:   

    Freely placeable
    Easily storable ( >2 in Eurocrate)
    Central monitoring (vehicles detected, battery state) and control (emergency/utility vehicle or BH shuttle in/out NOW)

    Nice to have:

    state report to BH infra map
    portable auxiliary controller to assist pacing traffic between camp and parking during start or finish of camp



Legal and organisational aspects:

    Should sufficiently look like a traffic light that people will act on the signal; should not 
        be mistaken for an official one -> single-light units w. WS2812-based panels?.
    Minimise obstruction of normal traffic by vehicles turning off from main road towards junction/venue

    Explanatory text in BH ticket?
